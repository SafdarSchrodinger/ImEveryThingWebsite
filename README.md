Using Physics Principles , specially The Conservation Principle We're going to create a system that people register as nodes of a Network, with StructuredFeatures  related to their life. then making connections between the nodes , based on their features. They have needs ,also skills abilities and ownership. solve the Equation:WhoNeedsWhat?WhoCan?

GPT-SafdarQuery_0:
I'd like to develop some in-depended  different projects in different fields with different GPTs , but they always can have connections with each other. so how can I share project development memory of one gpt with another gpt to integrate 2 projects or more, united in a single project as well as possible and needed?
generally how can have a meeting between several gpts that developed a project , they share theirselves information and select the best pieces of each other , put together and create a Comprehensive system that has many units connected with each other via some features values conditions or something...
for example : 
Project1: SafdarAlgorithmicTradingSystem
-uses python to develop a professional AutoTradingSystem that its file structure covers the full process of connecting to broker(and example for now=mt5) , select some existing charts to analyze(user assigns) , define strategies (the most Profitable & Popular strategies + SelfCreativeIdeas like using physics Principles) , optimize the results of strategies , and generate signals with position sizing metrics  , get positions based on final absolute signals and store all data beforeGetPosition(analyzes)+CurrentState+AfterGetPosition(results of closed positions) in mysql db , and synchronized with each level of development , develop its corresponding GUI in PHP To Control Trading System by user.

Project2: ImEveryThing_PhpWebsite
as seems from its name it's going to be everyOne And everyThing that can be related to everyOne and everyThing and make interactions with its different instantiates based on their features.
It would be following Physics Principles to translate the actual life of people into a digital online Network and automate many tasks of them and solve many lifeChalenges of them. It would be including everything related with their lives, their needs and essentials , their skills and abilities , their interesting and education and many many other data. We should to create Dynamic Form Creator that each user can create their own favorite and needed forms to define their plan,project or ... form submitions.
this would be developed in many different fields such as Foods , Houses , Wears , Transportation , Finance , Education , Industry... that each one would be an autonomous website , connectable to each other
But I don't want to create each one separately , instead I'd like to create a platform with modules be able to used for create all websites , just maybe need to a little customization. then Using that create and Develop All Different Units or websites

also using git-github to versioning at each level of development.

I need to have following GPTs working Together as said:
Physics and Math master
Php_html_css_js_ and more MAster
Python_AlgorithmicTrading Master
Python or Php Feature Engineering Master
